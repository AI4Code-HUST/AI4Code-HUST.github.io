    "description": "Our research group is headed by Prof. Huynh Quyet Thang. Our members include faculty members, graduate students, and undergraduate students from Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Besides, we have collaborated with prestigious professors and researchers at world-class universities such as The University of Melbourne and Singapore Management University. Our team primarily works at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence. We are mainly focusing on automated tools that can improve the reliability, transparency, and performance of Software and AI systems and increase developer productivity. Our works have been published in major and premier conferences and journals in software engineering and related fields such as IEEE TSE, ICSE, ESEC/FSE, and ICSME.",
